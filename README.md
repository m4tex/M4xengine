## Rendering
There is a lot of abstraction for the vanilla OpenGL objects and operations for less repetition and cleaner code.

## Engine
Engine classes and types are the essential features that define the final workflow like the input system or collisions.

## Built in classes
Game objects that implement the basic stuff so you don't have to.
### List
